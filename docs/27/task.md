# Task: Split AI Agent Trust blog post into series

## Description
The original blog post "AI Agent Trust and Observability" was quite long and covered several distinct topics. The goal was to split it into three separate posts and add a fourth post derived from a TIL about Shadow AI Agents.

## User Story
As a blog author, I want to split the long "AI Agent Trust and Observability" post into focused, digestible parts so that readers can more easily engage with each topic area independently.

## Requirements
- Split `src/content/blog/2026/01/ai-agent-trust-observability.md` into 3 parts.
- Move "AI Adoption in Software Development Teams" to its own post.
- Move "Customer Persona" and "PRD" to their own post.
- Create a new blog post from the TIL `shadow-ai-agents-automation-debt.md`.
- All posts must use the same hero image and belong to the same `ai_agents` series.
- Maintain the original post as the series intro.
