# Walkthrough - Mobile Layout Optimization

I have optimized the blog's mobile experience to increase content density and improve navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Header & Navigation (Mobile)
- **Single-Line Header**: Combined the site title and a new "Menu" toggle on a single row.
- **Hamburger Menu**: Implemented a functional menu toggle with a hamburger icon. The menu expands into a dropdown.
- **Hidden Subtitle**: Removed the "Personal notebook..." subtitle on mobile to save vertical space.
- **Refined Title**: Reduced the site title's font size to match standard body text (~1rem) on mobile.

### 2. Post Listing Density (Mobile)
- **Reduced Gaps**: Changed the space between post entry boxes to exactly `1px`.
- **Compacted Padding**: Reduced internal padding within post cards.
- **Smaller Thumbnails**: Reduced hero images to `24px` and kept them inline with the post title/content.
- **Smaller Titles**: Reduced post title font size for a cleaner look on small screens.

### 3. Consistency
Applied the same mobile optimizations across:
- Home page
- Tag detail pages
- Category detail pages
- Series detail pages

## Verification Results

### Visual Checks
- **Subtitle**: Verified as hidden on 375px viewport.
- **Menu**: Verified functional toggle and dropdown appearance.
- **Thumbnails**: Verified as 24px inline images.
- **Spacing**: Verified 1px vertical gap between entries.
