AI coding tools deliver clear value but create risks of unmanageable legacy code and inconsistent developer practices. 

- **Developer teams already use AI agents like Cursor and Claude but lack visibility into the prompting and decision process**

  - Managers want to understand how programmers achieved outcomes through prompt sequences and tool use
  - Without a repeatable formula, teams struggle to maintain consistent workflows or compare productivity across approaches
  - Current chat logs are insufficient; interpreted, structured insights are needed to guide development practices
  - Automated testing verifies output correctness, but process transparency remains a large gap

- **There is a real risk of accumulating "AI legacy code" that's hard to maintain due to stylistic inconsistencies between AI models**

  - Different AI programming agents produce distinct coding styles, causing conflicts and regressions when switching tools
  - This fragmentation threatens long-term maintainability and increases technical debt
  - Freezing common artifacts like specs or markdown documents could enable continuity across different AI tools
  - The goal is to prevent repeatedly tearing down foundations when migrating between agents or upgraded models

- **Smaller teams face the greatest struggle with AI agent management due to limited resources, while larger teams can absorb the complexity**

  - Junior developers relying heavily on AI risk not developing critical skills, as noted in recent Anthropic research
  - Smaller teams lack bandwidth for sophisticated governance or custom tooling
  - This gap presents a significant market opportunity for solutions that simplify observability and process control for lean teams
