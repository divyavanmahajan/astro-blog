Today I learned about Anthropic's randomized controlled trial examining how AI coding assistance affects skill development. The findings are sobering.

## The Key Finding

Developers using AI assistance scored **17% lower** on comprehension quizzes compared to those who coded by hand—the equivalent of nearly two letter grades. The AI group averaged 50% on the quiz versus 67% for the hand-coding group.

The largest gap was on **debugging questions**, suggesting that understanding *when code is incorrect and why it fails* is particularly impaired when relying on AI.

## The Nuance

Not all AI usage is equal. Participants who retained stronger mastery used AI differently:
- Asked **follow-up questions**
- Requested **explanations** of the code
- Posed **conceptual questions** while coding independently

They used AI to build comprehension, not just produce code.

## The Tension

This creates a workplace dilemma:
- AI can reduce task completion time by up to 80% for *existing* skills
- But AI may *hinder acquisition* of new skills
- Junior developers under time pressure may sacrifice learning for speed—then lack the skills to debug issues later

## The Takeaway

> *"Cognitive effort—and even getting painfully stuck—is likely important for fostering mastery."*

When learning something new, consider using AI's "learning modes" (like Claude Code Learning mode or ChatGPT Study Mode) rather than just copy-pasting solutions. The struggle is part of the skill-building process.
